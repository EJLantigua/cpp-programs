#Game of Pig
##Description
This program showcases base knowledge of looping through code and establishing a game
between two players(in this code). The player who is in turn gets to role a dice and
after every roll that doesn't land on 1 gets to either roll again or let the other player go. 
If a player rolls a 1 their score resets and otherwise adds up to 100. 
Whoever gets to 100+ wins.

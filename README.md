## Description of Each Program
### Basic School System
This program was intended to showcase knowlegde with inheritance to establish a school classification system.
This program works using dynamic binding. I wanted to be able to any individual who has been added to the system 
with basic confidential information and having the right classification of groups. This can make it alot easier to
add different level of priviledges later if the application was to continue being built out.

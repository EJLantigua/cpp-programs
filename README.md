## Description of Each Program
### Basic School System
This program showcases knowlegde with inheritance to establish a school classification system.
This program works using dynamic binding. I wanted any individual who has been added to the system 
with basic confidential information and having the right classification of groups. This can make it alot easier to
add different level of priviledges later if the application was to continue being built out. 
### Basic Inheritance with Coordinates
This program showcases base knowlegde with inheritance with a Point Class, Circle Class, and Cylinder Class.
The potential I see with the program could be a piece to starting a project adding a GUI project.
### Crypotgraphy Messages
This program showcases base knowledge of how to encrypt and decrypt messages. The potential I see with the program
would be the base level of security with encrypting messages being sent while the receiver able to decrypt the message.
### Game of Pig
This program showcases base knowledge of looping through code and establishing a game between two players(in this code).
The player who is in turn gets to role a dice and after every roll that doesn't land on 1 gets to either roll again or let
the other player go. If a player rolls a 1 their score resets and otherwise adds up to 100. Whoever gets to 100+ wins.
